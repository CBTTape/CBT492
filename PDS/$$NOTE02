Hi Sam,

tnx this explain also why some coding written by Jerry Morris
years ago contains some coding like

 STRING 5X,'Logname(',
       (XPRM_LOGNAME+1,L'XPRM_LOGNAME-1,T),
       ') +',INTO=LINE

Seems he never fixed the real problem for some reason.
Ok will insert the extra character and also fix the coding
to avoid the +1 on several places

Roland
