This note concerns SHOWzOS 7.16.

Assembly was done on z/OS 1.8, 1.7, 1.6, and 1.5, and the errors were
fixed by Roland Schiradin, according to the results of the assemblies
and the subsequent testing of SHOWzOS 7.16 on those system levels.
The resulting SHOWzOS source was marked (in the ISPF stats) as REVISED.
Roland now considers this version the "official" SHOWzOS 7.16.

Tests are now being undertaken on z/OS 1.4.  Results are not yet in.
