This is a correction to the IKJXPRM macro, which didn't conform
to reality (in a real z/OS 1.4 system).  I just fixed it up and
put it out there.  The code is now correct on the SHOWZOS 7.13
macro library.

Roland looked at the SHOWMVS code and saw that it compensated for
the fact that the XPRM_LOGNAME field was one byte before it should
have been.

Some "size fields" have also been discovered.  Here is a piece of
the corrected code:

XPRM_SOUT DS   C                       SYSOUT class
         DS    C                       ?
XPRM_LOGNAME DS CL8                    LOGNAME
         DS    H                       ?
XPRM_LOGSEL_1 DS C                     '*'
XPRM_LOGSEL DS  CL8                    LOGSEL name
XPRM_LOGSEL_SIZE DS H                  LOGSEL size (halfword)
XPRM_SYSCTL DS CL44                    SYSCTL name
XPRM_SYSCTL_SIZE DS H                  SYSCTL size (halfword)
XPRM_USRCTL DS CL44                    USRCTL name
XPRM_USRCTL_SIZE DS H                  USRCTL size (halfword)
XPRM_SPOOLCL DS C                      SPOOL CLASS
