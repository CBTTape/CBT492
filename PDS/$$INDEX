     SHOWJCL   JCL to assemble/link and run ShowMvs in different
               ways.

     SHOWMACS  IEBUPDTE JOB that loads the macros required for
               ShowMVS/ShowzOS into the SHOWMACS library.

     SHOWMENU  Code from David Alcock to invoke ShowMvs in edit mode

     SHOWMENM  Edit macro from David Alcock (please move this to
               lib which is a part of your ISPF SYSEXEC allocation)

     SHOWMENP  Panel from David Alcock (please move this to
               lib which is a part of your ISPF ISPPLIB allocation)

     SHOWM630  Same as ShowMacs but for version Show630 (frozen)

     SHOWSAS   SAS code to display the SMF data from SHOWzOS
               Tnx to Mp Welch

     SHOWzOS   New name and this version require Z/Architecure and
               z/OS R3 or above

               Program - Produces several different displays
               about your MVS system

               This program displays information obtained from
               various control blocks of the MVS system on which
               it runs.  The information can be displayed under
               ISPF using EDIF or BRIF, written to the TSO ter-
               minal using PUTLINE or to a data set using QSAM.

               ShowzOS displays two different types of data:
