             Running SHOWzOS as a Command Table Entry
             ------- ------- -- - ------- ----- -----


It has been our experience that it is better not to run SHOWzOS as a
program, in the command table entry, but rather as a TSO command.  One
way that works is the following:

SHOWZOS/5/SELECT CMD(SHOWZOS &ZPARM) MODE(FSCR)/Invoke SHOWzOS Command/

If you do this, you can enter SHOWZ on the command line, press ENTER,
and SHOWZOS will be invoked.

 Warning -   Do NOT say:  SELECT PGM(SHOWZOS)   because you most
                                                probably will get
                                                a S0C4 abend or
                                                something similar.
