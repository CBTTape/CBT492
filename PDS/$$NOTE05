Hi Sam,

Attached is the latest version of 7.19. The "last" bug was
fixed. Was a wild branch while assembled under z/OS R10 and run
the load under z/OS R8.

I'm out of office for two weeks starting in the middle of next
week. I attend to share conference during 24. Aug. - 28. Aug and
will give a presentation about SHOWzOS and COBAnal.

All the best to you all.

Roland
