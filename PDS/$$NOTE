Keep in mind that ShowzOS require Z/Architecture and z/OS R3.
ShowMvs (the older version) will not work under z/OS R6.
If you still run older hardware or older operating system you may
look at ShowMvs or in case of very old hardware look at Show6xx

Now what's new:

XP2JCL and X2PXMIT contains JCL and load libaries to create a PDF
document of the SHOWzOS output. This tool is written by Martin
Truebner and it's a comercial product. I really like it and
directly ftp it a server so everybody can open the data in his
PDF viewer. This way you can easily create PDF documents on your
z/OS or VSE system and very fast. The mainframe can do this !!!!
