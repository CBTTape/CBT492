Notes about SHOWzOS 7.21.

0.  SHOWzOS 7.22 is absolutely necessary to run with z/OS 2.1.

1.  SHOWzOS 7.21 should be good, through z/OS 1.13.

2.  z/OS 2.1 was supposed to come out for General Availability
    in September 2012.  It has since been postponed to September 2013.

3.  During preliminary testing of SHOWzOS 7.21 under z/OS 2.1 (before
    it was known that the new z/OS release would be postponed), a bug
    was discovered in SHOWzOS 7.21 and not yet fixed.

4.  Since it should be over a year before the problem might be
    encountered in z/OS, I am releasing the current SHOWzOS version
    7.21 now, with this caveat.  Don't use it on z/OS 2.1 until the
    bug is fixed.  (SG - July 2012)

5.  SHOWzOS 7.21 is not yet the "default SHOWzOS" in this pds.  For
    SHOWzOS 7.21, members are:

            SHOWZ721  -  source code
            SHOWM721  -  7.21 macro library
            SHOWJ721  -  JCL to assemble
