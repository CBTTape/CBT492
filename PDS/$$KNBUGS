                           KNOWN BUGS
                           ----- ----

1.  The "LAST CLPA" report, for OS/390 releases 2.7 and before, may
    not show accurate values.  The reason is because at that point,
    IBM was mucking around with paging dataset formats, where the
    "LAST CLPA" information was being kept.  SHOWMVS 7.09 was fixed
    (hopefully) to correctly show LAST CLPA information (when running
    authorized) for OS/390 2.8 and above, so SHOWMVS 7.09 works
    properly for those MVS releases.

 Illustration of the situation:

   OS/390 Release 2.4

   OS/390 Release 2.8 and above including current z/OS R4

Last Quick Start (CVIO) Date: 2004-03-31   Time: 22.24.09

2.  The IHASCA was gone in z/OS R5. ShowMvs and SHOWzOS assembled on
    z/OS R5 will not report the IHASCA on prev. releases. This is a
    permanent restriction!!!

3.  Hercules doesn't provide support of the new DIAG204 instructions
    This will cause abends. I informed the Hercules team so hopefully
    we will see support in upcomming version of Hercules.
    (A bugfix for Hercules is available )

4.  SHOWzOS require an OMVS Segment.
